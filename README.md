_Building data platforms that actually matter for real businesses._

## The Problem We See
There's a massive gap in the market that frustrates us every day. Small companies can't afford proper data capabilities, and big companies have them but they're bloated and slow. Meanwhile, middle-size companies are stuck in the middle, growing fast but making critical decisions based on incomplete information.
These companies want to be data-driven, but they face an impossible choice: hire an expensive team of specialists they can't afford, or keep making gut decisions and hope for the best. Neither option feels right.

## What We're Building
We're creating a different path. A way for growing companies to get enterprise-level data capabilities without the enterprise overhead. We want to be the team that comes in, understands their business, and builds exactly what they need to make better decisions.
This means real impact work. Helping a manufacturing company optimize their supply chain. Showing a SaaS business which features actually drive retention. Giving a retailer the insights to expand into new markets confidently. The kind of projects where you can see the business change because of what you built.

## The Work We Want to Do
We believe data work should be about solving real business problems, not just implementing the latest tech. We want to work with companies where leadership actually cares about making better decisions, where our work directly impacts their success.
This means getting close to the business, understanding their challenges, and building solutions that people actually use. It means quality over quantity, depth over breadth. It means saying no to projects that don't create real value.

## Where We Stand
Right now, it's just me working to prove this model works. I'm looking for people who share this vision and want to build something meaningful together. People who get excited about turning messy business problems into clean, useful data systems.
If you're tired of corporate bureaucracy and want to do work that directly impacts real businesses, this might be for you. If you believe that good data capabilities shouldn't be reserved for Fortune 500 companies, let's talk.

## What's Next
We're starting small and building something sustainable. The goal isn't to become a massive consultancy, but to create a focused team that does exceptional work for companies that appreciate it.
